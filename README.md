# micro_blog

## Synopsis

A micro-blogging app created with Sinatra on Ruby 2.4.0. Users can make posts of up to 150 characters, see the latest 10 posts on the app, and see lists of posts by themselves and other users. After registering, users can update their account information in the account settings area, where they can also delete their account. 

## Motivation

To become familiar with building a web aplication using Sinatra.

## Installation

Run `bundle` to install required gems and then run `rake db:migrate` to setup databases.
